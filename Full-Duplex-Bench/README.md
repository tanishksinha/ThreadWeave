## 🏗️ Repository Architecture
Due to the evolution of evaluation paradigms—from static dataset evaluation to dynamic real-time interaction—this repository is organized into distinct architectures:

### [Full-Duplex-Bench v1 & v1.5 (Static Offline Evaluation)](./v1_v1.5)
**👉 [Dive into v1 & v1.5](./v1_v1.5/README.md)**

The **legacy v1 and v1.5** pipelines evaluate models based on pre-recorded static datasets in an offline, server-client inference manner.
- **Highlights (v1.0)**: Systematically assesses 4 dimensions: Pause Handling, Backchanneling, Smooth Turn-Taking, and User Interruption. ([FDB v1.0 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04721))
- **Highlights (v1.5)**: Extends the benchmark with overlap scenarios including listener backchannel, side conversation, and ambient speech. ([FDB v1.5 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23159))

### [Full-Duplex-Bench-v2 (Real-Time Dynamic Evaluation)](./v2)
**👉 [Dive into v2](./v2/README.md)** | [Demo Website](https://ericsunkuan.github.io/full-duplex-bench-v2-demo/)

**FDB-v2** is our actively evolving, state-of-the-art framework. It orchestrates **real-time audio conversations** (via WebRTC or WebSocket) between your target model (the Examinee) and an automated AI evaluator (the Examiner). 
- **Highlights**: Dynamic multi-turn tasks, WebRTC Node.js orchestrator, conversational constraints, LLM-as-a-judge automated scoring. ([FDB v2.0 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07838))
- **Use Case**: Best for evaluating how well a model converses reactively in a live environment.

### [Full-Duplex-Bench-v3 (Tool Use Under Real-World Disfluency)](./v3)
**👉 [Dive into v3](./v3/README.md)** | [Demo Website](https://daniellin94144.github.io/FDB-v3-demo/) | [Download Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SO_4MTazWQ_jvCx0dtmpQ-t40bdd07yz/view?usp=sharing)

**FDB-v3** (*Benchmarking Tool Use for Full-Duplex Voice Agents Under Real-World Disfluency*) combines **real human disfluent speech** with **multi-step tool use** to evaluate voice agents under realistic conditions.
- **What we built**: Real human recordings annotated across 5 disfluency types (fillers, pauses, hesitations, false starts, self-corrections), paired with chained API calls across 4 task domains.


## 🧭 Getting Started

Depending on your goal, please navigate to the respective folder:

- **To run offline static evaluations or reproduce results from our v1.0/v1.5 papers:**  
  Navigate to the [`v1_v1.5/` directory](./v1_v1.5) to view datasets, setup offline inference, and compute static metrics.

- **To benchmark a model using the latest real-time automated AI examiner (v2):**  
  Navigate to the [`v2/` directory](./v2) and follow the combined Node.js and Python setup instructions.

- **To evaluate voice agents on multi-step tool calling with real human disfluent speech (v3):**  
  Navigate to the [`v3/` directory](./v3) and follow the setup instructions. Download the benchmark data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SO_4MTazWQ_jvCx0dtmpQ-t40bdd07yz/view?usp=sharing).
